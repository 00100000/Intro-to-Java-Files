# Note
I only handed in CozaLozaWoza and Palindrome. They were the hardest out of all 4, and I was more sure of my work on them than
on Zinnformatics and MailingLabel. MailingLabel because of the regex method used, and Zinnformatics because there was some
sort of annoying multiplication issue I was just too lazy to fix.
